# arch-clean

A simple program to run some maintainance tasks for Arch Linux devices. It was
previously done in bash, and I should have kept it that way because it was much
simpler. But for the sake of learning Rust I parallelized the work to make it a
bit faster. It's also meant to be extensible for future commands.
